      <h1>Splashes of Childhood</h1>
      <p>Summer afternoons spent in Karachi at Na home were always filled with joy and adventure. One of my favorite childhood memories is of the water balloon fights that I had with my siblings, Ayla & Ibrahim and my cousins, Azka, Ammar and Emaan. As kids, we would stand in the kitchen for hours, tying the delicate knots of the balloons. Once we had equally divided the balloons, chaos erupted. Water balloons flew through the air, exploding upon impact sending shrieks of excitement that echoed through the garden. Our smiles were contagious and our laughter was infections. </p>

<p>Over time, we grew up and the water balloon fights became a thing of the past. This summer, Azka and I found ourselves reminiscing and we realized how our younger cousins had never experienced the same magic as us, and so one hot summer afternoon, we revived the tradition. </p>
    <p>The afternoon felt like we had stepped back into our childhood, laughter and giggles filled the air as our little cousins experienced the same magic as we did when we were little. As the sun set and the water balloons finished, I watched our little cousins giggle, their eyes filled with excitement, pleading to have another water balloon fight the next day. I realized that time had come full circle, Azka, Ayla, Ammar, Emaan, Ibrahim and I were no longer the same kids of summers past but instead we had grown from participants to observers. That was the day that I gained a deeper appreciation for childhood and that was the day when I knew that  memories like this one, would always be cherished. </p>
