            <p>At the age of 12, it felt like everyone was navigating the challenges of pre-teen life and were trying to find their place. One Direction's song "What Makes You Beautiful" spoke directly to my heart. Singing along with my best friends at sleepovers made us feel invincible! The songs lyrics lifted our spirits and created a sense of confidence.</p>
            <p>As we sang "You're insecure, don't know what for" our voices blended in harmony and we entered a world where everything seemed perfect.</p>
