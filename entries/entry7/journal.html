<p>One Direction was the soundtrack of my childhood. It shaped my childhood and memories. Their songs sparked daydreams, sleepovers, sing-alongs, dance-offs.
    Their songs evoked various feelings and emotions in me, they provided me with comfort and inspiration. </p>
<br> 
<p>From the upbeat meoldies of songs like "Best Song Ever" to the hearfelt ballad of "Little Things" I was obsessed with them and their songs. Over time, I was also able to start relating to the lyrics in the songs which formed a deeper connection between me and the music.
    They inspired me to embrace my individuality and to be confident.</p>
