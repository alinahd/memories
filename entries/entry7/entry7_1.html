                <p>It was 2014, school had just started a few months ago. One day in November, the news that One Direction had dropped their new album "Midnight Memories" spread all across the school. My friends and I would try convincing every one of our teachers to play their music in class. Their song "Best Song Ever" was the catchiest one on the album. One day, during lunchtime, my friends and I were having lunch in the school's auditorium when we decided to get on the stage and perform "Best Song Ever". As the music began, we jumped, sang and danced and our voices echoed through the auditorium:
                "How we danced all night to the best song ever"
                "We knew every line, now I can't remember"
                It was pure magic, we had no worries, no doubts; it was just a day full of friendship and joy. Even now when the song plays, I feel like I am 11 years old all over again. This song will forever hold a special place in my heart.</p>
