          <p>In the summer of 2015, Made in the A.M. became my sisters favorite One Direction album. She would force everyone to listen to it on repeat during long drives to the beach, not that I was complaining. She would blast the song "Story of My Life" before we all got a chance to leave the house and start our journey. The songs cachy lyrics and tune got stuck in my head but its significance grew over time. At such a young age, I didn't completely understand the song lyrics but reflecting on it now makes me realize that the song "Story of My Life" was more than just lyrics, it symbolized various things</p>
          <p>Laughter with my family and friends</p>
          <p>Endless summer nights at the beach</p>

          <p>Today when the song plays, empowerment surges and memories rush back. Till this day, it remains a tribute to love and friendship for me.</p>
