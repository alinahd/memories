                <p>One Direction's album "Four" has a many songs, out of all of them, the song "You and I" was my favorite. I used to listen to this song all the time, no matter what I would be doing. As a child, I imagined that the relationship the band was singing out was between two people who were in love with eachother, I would often relate the song to the way I saw my parents relationship with each other. Both of these together I think influenced my perception of what being in love felt, sounded and looked like.</p>
