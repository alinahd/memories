            <p>"Rock Me" was one of the many songs I learnt during my music class in school. This was a song that everyone knew, it's infectious energy spread like wildfire. During high school field trips, this song would always be played, and would soon be followed by all of us singing along. During these field trips, the buses would transform into karoke parties in which even the teachers couldn't help but sing along or tap their feet to the beat. </p>
