    <h2>The First Time I Played with Makeup</h2>
    <div class="memory-content">
        <p>Since I was a kid, I was obsessed with makeup and dressing up. As a child, I would take my mom’s eyeshadow palette and put it on myself. One day, my parents were downstairs at a function that was taking place in our garden while I was supposed to be asleep, instead I decided to mix all my mom’s eyeshadow colors and do my makeup and go downstairs to join the function and so when I first got my toy makeup dresser, I was beyond excited. The tiny lipstick, the sparkling eyeshadow, and the cute little brush... it felt like I had my own little beauty salon.</p>

    <h2>The Colors, The Sparkles, and The Imagination</h2>
    <div class="memory-content">
        <p>The makeup dresser was like a treasure chest for me, it had lipsticks, blush and eyeshadow palettes. Every color in my toy makeup set was magical to me. I would sit on the tiny stool in front of it, and do my makeup. My cheeks would be covered in a glittery pink blush, and I would apply eeyshadow with my little fingers smearing it on my eyelds unevenly. Eyeshadow was my favorite product in there, I would call it "Aedoshadow" because I couldn't pronoune it right yet and I would go around putting eyeshadow on everyone, my mom, my grandma, my dolls.</p>
