            <h2>My First Musical</h2>
            <p>At the age of nine, I participated in my first musical. During one of our dance classes in school, my friends and I were chosen to take part in a play based off of the movie; “The Sound of Music”. Every day after school, we would have rehearsals in my school during which my friends and I would often play games and mess around while also practicing for the play. Our teachers would sometimes order us pizza to motivate us to practice. We spent days learning the dances and the songs. My school got our costumes for the play custom stitched for each of us and we all were given our own outfits for the day. From practicing after classes on school days to our dress rehearsals, we were finally ready for the big day. Before the play, I went to the salon with my mom and got my hair styled. It made me feel special and created a sense of excitement in me. Despite being determined to getting the steps right, I was much more determined on having fun with my friends and trying something different and new. 

                Over time, I think I have lost this mindset of focusing on having more fun and experiencing something and instead I have become more focused on getting something “right” or making something “perfect”. Watching these videos and looking at these pictures, I am taken back to a time in my childhood when playfulness and laughter filled my days. The videos rekindle happy memories that had faded over time and allow me to see the innocence and delight that filled my childhood. They allow me to experience the same joy that I felt as a child, for example, getting my hair done at the salon while it is still something I do at 19, the pictures of me at salon at the age of 9 evoke happiness in me because I found something so mundane exciting and I had forgotten that dressing up was actually something that I have loved since childhood.
