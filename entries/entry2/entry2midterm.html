            <h1>Home Sweet Home</h1>
            <p>Everyone is home.</p>
            <p>It's mid december in Karachi, cold but not too cold.
                You're 14 years old.
                Your grandmother, mom and aunts are all in the kitchen, its full of laughter, chatter and music. The smell of freshly made biryani fills the air, soon followed by the sugary, rich aroma of chocolate and caramel. Your grandfather, dad and uncles are watching tv, your younger siblings are swimming.
                Everyone is busy doing their own thing but everyone is home.</p>
            <p>The sun sets and everyone rushes to their rooms to get ready.
                The clock hits 8:00 and the doorbell starts ringing, and finally everyone is home.
                Everyone is here, the close relatives, the ones you see all the time and even the distant relatives, the ones you see during this specific time of the year.
                Everyone gathers in the backyard, the food is spread out on the tables, the kids are running around, your parents are meeting everyone.</p>
            <p>The grown ups sit on the "grown up" table while you and your siblings and cousins sit on the "kids" table. You play twister with your cousins, jump in the pool, run around with no worries whatsoever.</p>
            <p>After a day full of chaos, laughter and fun, you lay in your childhood bedroom dreaming about the future, and how you can't wait to grow up and sit on the "grown up" table. You get so focused on growing up that you forget to breathe and take in the fact that you are surrounded with your loved ones ALL in ONE room. 
            Because now you're 19 living in a new city with no family around, not knowing when you'll see everyone together again, not knowing when everyone will be home once again.</p>
            <h2>Remember to enjoy the moments before they become memories.</h2>
