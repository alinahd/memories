    <p>I had been looking forward to this day since my parents announced that we would be going to the beach this coming Sunday. Every summer my family and I would go to the beach almost every other weekend. We would buy so many things for our day at the beach like snacks, drinks, donuts, chips, food for lunch and the list goes on. The day before going to the beach, my mom and grandma would prepare all the snacks and food. Before we would leave for the beach, they would pack the food into a large cooler box with ice. Once everyone was ready, we would leave for the beach, my cousins and I would sit in the back of the truck and play music as we began our one hour drive through the main road to “French Beach” in Karachi (my favorite place on earth). </p>
    <p>Once we got there, my cousins and I would run to the clear, blue sea. My parents would bring all the coolers and bags inside the beach house and would set everything down. The beach would always be full of people, some would be playing volleyball, others would be building sandcastles, some would be doing camel rides while others would be having beach parties. There would even be some people going on a boat ride! </p>
    <p>We would spend the whole day at the beach, running in and out of the water, having sandcastle competitions, laying in the sand and taking camel rides across the beach. At night, we would have barbecues along with which I would always drink some Pakola.</p>
