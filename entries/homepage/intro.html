<p>Who am I without nostalgia? <br> Nostalgia might just be the most beautiful ache of all. 
<br>Cruel and wonderful at once...this quiet, tender sadness that somehow wraps itself in warmth. <br>
<br>Its the way certain places, sounds, or scents pull you back to who you once were. 
<br>The soft ache of knowing those pieces of your past are still part of you, but time has separated you from them, leaving only the bittersweet beauty of what once was.<br>
<br>There's a longing, a quiet acceptance that some moments were never meant to last. 
<br> But still, they remain haunting and comforting, unreachable yet soothing.<br>
<br> And why is it that, in the present moment, we rarely feel that our experiences are nostalgia-worthy?
<br> Yet, years later, we look back on them with warmth and longing, finding meaning that wasn't obvious at the time. <br> 
<br> Is it nostalgia's purpose to make us hold the present closer, or is it simply the most beautiful ache of all?
