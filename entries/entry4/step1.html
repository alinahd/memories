 <h1>Lets Get Started!</h1>
<p>1.	It's Saturday morning, I wake up and rush downstairs to the kitchen. </p>
<br>
<p>2.	My mom’s recipe books are piled up on the counter waiting for me to explore and find a new recipe for the day. </p>
<br>
<p>3.	I take a seat on the tall brown stool and start flipping through the books when I see the words “Oreo Cheesecake” written across the page I yell “found it!” and race to my mom to tell her. </p>
<br>
<p>4.	My mom sits on the stool, and instructs me to first take out all the ingredients I need to make the cake.</p>
<br>
<p>5.	This part, I hate, I run across the kitchen trying to carry as many things as possible so that I can start the fun part, the part where there’s batter all over my clothes and where the entire kitchen is filled with the aroma of vanilla essence. </p>
