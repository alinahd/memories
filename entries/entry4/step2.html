 <h1>Mix It Up!</h1>

 <p>6. Yay! I finally have all the ingredients laid out on the table. Now the fun starts!</p>
 <br>
 <p>7. We go over the game plan and start baking. We start by working on it step by step. </p>
 <br>
 <p>8. I open the Oreo packets, and start separating the cream filling, while also eating a couple every now and then. </p>
 <br>
 <p>9.	I start crushing the biscuit part with a big, heavy, silver hammer and then I mix it in with butter. </p>
 <br>
 <p>10.	My mom shows me how to line the pan using the Oreos and butter, she says “you have to take your time with it, don’t rush it.” </p>
 <br>
 <p>11.	So naturally, I rush “Alinah take your time and do it properly” says mama and so I slow down and finish lining the pan. </p>
 <br>
 <p>12.	We put it in the freezer and start working on the batter and I learn the coolest thing! If you keep beating egg whites, they’ll eventually turn so stiff that if you flip the bowl they won’t fall out! </p>
 <br>
 <p>13.	As we finish making the batter, we pour it into the pan and freeze. Here comes the boring part again, we have to wait at least 12 hours for it to be done. Ugh! </p>
