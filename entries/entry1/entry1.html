        <h1>Life in Plastic, It's Fantastic! </h1>
          
          <p>It’s the early 2000s, I drop my school bag and race to the TV. I’m sitting cross – legged on the floor with my eyes glued to the screen as Barbie’s latest adventure unfolds. Barbie’s sugary sweet voice told tales of friendship and adventure. Her laughter was contagious and her clothes were an array of fluffy, frilly, pink fabulous outfits! </p>
          <p>In Barbie’s world anything and everything seemed possible. In Barbie’s world, Barbie was a musketeer, a princess, a fairy, a mermaid, an astronaut, a rockstar and so much more.  </p>
          <p>As I watch the movies, I don’t have a care in the world, my only focus is <em>“how is barbie going to the save the day today?” </em> In this moment, I am free, free to be anyone and anything like barbie. And once the movie ends, and the credits roll and I say bye to barbie for the day, I know I can return again to this enchanted world, where dreams know no bounds, the very next day. </p>
          
          <p>The barbie movies that I cherished a kid, were more than simply entertainment they shaped my childhood.</p>

    <p> Looking back at these movies, I realize that as I navigate my life here in New York City, I have to power to create my own magic and live my life to the fullest. </p>
