    <p> Every sunday, my cousins and I would meet at our grandmas home for lunch. Right after lunch, we would all race to the living room to decide who would be the seeker. We would run around trying to find the best hiding spot in the house. Some of us were really good at finding new and innovative places to hide while the others would end up giving up their hiding spots by giggling. 
        In our version of hide and seek, when the seeker had finally found everyone, it would turn into a game of catch with the seeker running around trying to tag the rest. Once you were tagged you had to join forces with the seeker to tag anyone who remained. 
        The game always ended in laughter, with everyone out of breath yet eager to play again.
